# Google Scholar Plugin for Sublime Text 3

Many researchers use Sublime Text to author paper in Latex and have a need to quickly find a paper or a specific author of a paper. This idea for this plugin was inspired by the [Google Scholar Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-scholar-button/ldipcbpaocekfooobnbcddclnhejkcpn?hl=en) release, it is only an initial version (created in a few minutes). In the future, would be nice I can integrate the search results in Sublime Text itself (and import bibtex file directly).

## Install
At the moment you need to clone the repository and place the plugin folder in ```sublime-text-3/Packages/User```.

If this will be used by other people, I'll submit a request to add it to the [Sublime Package Manager](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).

## Use
Use one of the following key bindings

- 'Ctrl + o' : to use the selected text to search for a paper
- 'Shift + Ctrl + o' : to use the selected text to search for an author
- use 'Super' instead of 'Ctrl' for OS X

Alternatively it is possible to use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) instead of the key bindings.

## Beta
This plugin is in early development and may not work properly (or at all). Its design is still under development (I'm open to suggestions).
